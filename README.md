Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  They wanted a client-server application that would display pictures and quiz users as to what the picture is. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I feel like I did well at writing out the requirements and constraints. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  It gave me an idea of what I needed to keep in mind while finding solutions. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I haven't started the last section yet as of writing but I do feel like I had trouble with figuiring out what I needed to write for each operating systems differences when it comes to server and clinet.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  If your not considering the users needs than who is this software designed for? If the goal is to make the best product for the user than understanding their needs can help get a better idea of what the software needs to do.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I was working with code and libararies that I wasn't familair with. What helped was using my resources to figure it out and find a solution. The best programmers are also the best googlers. 
  It helped that the class provided enough resources for me to understand it enough to work with it.
